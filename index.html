  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello and Namaste! I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate in the Agricultural & Biological Engineering Department at University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to address real-world challenges faced by the agricultural sector. With a Ph.D. in Biological & Agricultural Engineering from Texas A&M University, I've delved into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and computer vision.My doctoral thesis focused on "Artificial Intelligence-Based Computer Vision for Rapid Detection and Classification of Objects in Agricultural Situations." This journey allowed me to combine my love for technology with my interest in agriculture, creating innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and sustainability.Equipped with expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and problem-solving, I'm dedicated to contributing to advancements that make a positive impact. I work with drones, robots and machines in general to find solutions to agricultural challenges. When I'm not immersed in research work, you might find me exploring the outdoors, appreciating the beauty of both the natural and digital worlds.Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the intersection of technology, agriculture, and innovation!</p>

  <h3>Current Projects as Post-Doctoral Research Associate at University of Florida, Gainesville, FL</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Citrus disease classification with convolution neural network generated features and machine learning classifiers on hyperspectral image data</strong><br>
      In this project, we are testing a newly developed portable hyperspectral imaging system with AI-based computer vision (CV) algorithms for early detection of citrus disease on fruits and leaves. The initial findings from this project were presented at the SPIE-DCS conference in Orlando, FL, and we are continuing to work on the system development so as to eventually integrate it on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) for autonomous imaging.<br>

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Citrus disease detection using convolution neural network generated features and Softmax classifier on hyperspectral image data</strong><br>
      In this project, we are exploring different dimension reduction techniques for hyperspectral image data and determining the most important bands so that a multispectral imaging system can be used with AI-based computer vision algorithms to detect different peel blemish conditions of citrus fruits. Initial findings were published in the journal Frontiers of Plant Science, and we continue to explore designing custom convolution neural networks (CNN) to improve detection performance.<br>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Detecting volunteer cotton plants in a corn field with deep learning on UAV remote-sensing imagery</strong><br>
      In this project the main objectives were (i) to determine whether  YOLOv3 deep learning algorithm could be used for volunteer cotton plant detection in a corn field based on UAV-derived RGB images, and (ii) to investigate the behavior of YOLOv3 on images at three different pixel scales (320 × 320, 416 × 416 and 512 × 512). The findings of this project were published in the journal Computers & Electronics in Agriculture.<br>

	<li>
	  <strong>Assessing the performance of YOLOv5 algorithm for detecting volunteer cotton plants in corn fields at three different growth stages</strong><br>
	  In this project, the application of CV algorithm based on YOLOv5 for detecting VC plants growing in the middle of corn fields at three different growth stages (V3, V6 and VT) were shown using UAS-acquired multispectral images. In this study, RGB images were generated from individual lens of five band multispectral camera for further processing with YOLOv5. The findings of this paper were published in the journal Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture.<br>

	 </li>
	<li>
	  <strong>Plastic Contaminant Detection in Aerial Imagery of Cotton Fields Using Deep Learning </strong><br>
	  In this study, YOLOv5 was used to detect brown and white color plastic bags in cotton fields at three different heights of plants. A statistical analysis revealed that both color of bags and their heights on cotton plants had significant effect on the detection accuracy. The findings were published in the journal Agriculture.<br>
	  <img class="project-image" src="https://pappuyadav.github.io/images/project6.png" alt="Project Image 6" width="600" height="338">

	<li>
	  <strong>Computer vision for volunteer cotton detection in a corn field with UAS remote sensing imagery and spot-spray applications </strong><br>
	  In this study a readily available broadcast spray drone was customized for precision spot-spray applications. It was also customized for AI-based computer vision applications for real-time plant detection. In this study, the detected plants’ central pixel-based coordinates were converted into GPS coordinates and then ant colony optimization algorithm was used to determine the optimal flight path for spot-spray applications at the detected plant locations. The findings of this study are available on arXiV, and the manuscript is under review for publication.<br>

	  <strong>GIS-based volunteer cotton habitat prediction and plant-level detection with UAV remote sensing </strong><br>
	  In this project, the objective was to develop a geographic information system (GIS) framework to efficiently locate volunteer cotton plants in the cotton production regions of south Texas, that has the potential to reducing time and economic cost for their removal. The findings of this study were published in the journal Computers & Electronics in Agriculture.
