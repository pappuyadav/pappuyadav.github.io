  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello and Namaste! I am a Post Doctoral Research Associate in the Agricultural & Biological Engineering Department at University of Florida, Gainesville, FL. I'm passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to address real-world challenges. With a Ph.D. in Biological & Agricultural Engineering from Texas A&M University, I've delved into the fascinating world of artificial intelligence and computer vision.My doctoral thesis focused on "Artificial Intelligence-Based Computer Vision for Rapid Detection and Classification of Objects in Agricultural Situations." This journey allowed me to combine my love for technology with my interest in agriculture, creating innovative solutions to enhance efficiency and sustainability.Equipped with expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and problem-solving, I'm dedicated to contributing to advancements that make a positive impact. I work with drones, robots and machines in general to find solutions to agricultural challenges. When I'm not immersed in rsearch work, you might find me exploring the outdoors, appreciating the beauty of both the natural and digital worlds.Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the intersection of technology, agriculture, and innovation!</p>
